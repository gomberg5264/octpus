### Requirements

* git - http://git-scm.com

### Getting started
Octopus video for 7.x requires several patches to be applied to Drupal core. It provides a `build-octopus-video.make` file for building a full Drupal distro including core patches as well as a copy of the `Octopus video` install profile. So run following.

```
$ drush make https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heidisoft/OctopusVideo/master/build-octopus-video.make [directory]
```

This will download all the required files for the distribution, so now access your site from the browser and choose "Octopus video" as the distribution then follow the steps.
